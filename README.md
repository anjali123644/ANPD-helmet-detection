# ANPD-helmet-detection
“YOLO-based system for automatic number plate and helmet detection using OCR and deep learning.”


This project implements **Automatic Number Plate Detection (ANPD)** and **Helmet Detection** using a YOLO-based object detection model combined with OCR (EasyOCR). It is designed for smart surveillance and traffic rule enforcement applications.
